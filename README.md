# Customized-Programming-Language
Generating a parser for a customized (imaginary) programming language, I have made a grammar for that customized programming language and checked that with right and wrong input.

# Grammar overview
Terminal and non-terminal symbols are the lexical parts used in deciding the creation rules setting up a customary programming language. Terminal symbols are simple symbols described by an ordinary programming language. Grammar is not just used to portray the formulation of a programming language, it is furthermore used to compiler forming.
1. Variables declaration: types of variable (int, float, double, bool, string)
2. Conditional statement: ( if-else)
3. Print statement: (print n )
4. Relational operator: (m==3, i==0)
5. Loop statement: (for loop, while loop)
6. Break statement: break
